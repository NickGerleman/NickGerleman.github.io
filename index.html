<!--
Oh shit, an engineer is looking at this. Hey buddy. Please excuse this
giant piece of spaghetti hacked together. This is a throwaway site in all
senses of the word. If you're looking at this to get a sense of the quality of
work I produce you're going to have a bad time.

Go look at my Github. But like one of the nicer projects. Oh wait... Half of
the things there are from hackathons. Uhh... Weasel is kinda nice? Maybe
over-documented a bit? Just trust me that these projects are me getting stuff
done quickly. If you want to get a better idea of how I work feel free to shoot
me an email or carrier pigeon. Honestly if you could send a carrier pigeon I
would just be super impressed.

                    My experience at Iowa State University has prepared me to design
                    large systems and related problems. Courses have challeneged me in a
                    variery of new areas. This has assisted me in having a breadth of
                    methods to approach problems and the capabilities to learn new methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Projects with other students have taught me valuable skills related to
                    interpersonel communication and group work. Ethical responsibilities have
                    been emphasized thoughout my college experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Work outside of the classroom has had an even greater contribution to
                    these skills. The ability to pursue personal projects and obtain internships
                    have been invaluable in obtaining real experience in large projects and
                    complex systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would change very little in my college experience given the ability to.
                    I would most likely has taken certain CprE courses such as their System
                    Architecture class instead of the CS equivalent. This would widen my breadth
                    of knowledge and allow me to solve more unique problems.

                    <h2>Engineering the Perfect Cat Collage</h2>

                    <p>
                        Fluffify was a 36 hour project created for HackISU Spring 2016. I led overall design of the
                        system. The goal of the project was to let a user create a massive collage of cute animal
                        pictures from an arbitrary image.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This was accomplished by first scraping a few thousand cute animal pictures using the imgur API.
                        The scraped images were intelligently cropped using OpenCV to choose the square image with the
                        most edges. The average color of each image is then recorded.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All of these images are then indexed into a KD tree where the color is represented as a point in
                        LAB color space. The collage is constructed by taking each pixel in the uploaded image and then
                        querying the KD tree for a similar image.

                    <h2>A Harrowing Proof of Concept</h2>

                    <p>
                        Stalkr was a 36 hour hackathon project created for HackISU Fall 2014 where it won first place. I
                        was responsible for the backend service. Stalkr is a proof of concept meant to illustrate a
                        serious vulnerability in the Grindr dating service.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A previous exploit showed it to be possible to track Grindr users through a process called
                        trilateration. While Grindr had stated this was resolved, we were curious if it actually was. We
                        wanted to see how much data could be obtained and to what precision we could track users.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We first reverse-engineered the Grindr API. We then created a fake user who would rapidly move
                        and record user distances. This data was used to guess the user's location. We were effectively
                        able to track users movements throughout the day within a block of accuracy.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Temporal Antialiasing</h1>
                    <h2>Fast and Gorgeous</h2>

                    <p>
                        This is a from-scratch implementation of Temporal Antialiasing built upon Three.js. This was
                        done during Fall 2016 for my final project in ComS 336: Introduction to Computer Graphics. This
                        implementation is relatively sophisticated, based on the presentations put out by Naughty Dog
                        and Unreal.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each frame is given a small jitter and composited with the previous in order to apply
                        supersampling over a period of multiple frames. Per object motion is recorded in between frames
                        in order to compensate for movement that may blur the result. Special techniques are used to
                        eliminate artifacts such as ghosting and flickering.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The end result is largely effective. It is able to achieve a dramatic improvement upon standard
                        MSAA while performing about 300% faster than SSAA.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Pantri</h1>
                    <h2>Ingredients made easy</h2>

                    <p>
                        Pantri was a 36 hour hackathon project created for HackISU Fall 2016 where it won third place.
                        Pantri allows users to quickly manage ingredients they own and find recipes that can use them.
                        I was responsible for recipe search, ingredient classification, and parts of the Android UI.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Pantri works by allowing the uset to enter or scan ingredients. Heuristics are used to classify
                        an ingredient by name using inverse term frequency. This technique was used to create a forest
                        of several thousand ingredients including a hierarchy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Recipes were scraped from AllRecipes.com and ingredients were classified by listed name. The
                        user is able to see a randomized list of top recipes that were identified to be able to be
                        created with the ingredients the user already has.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Nimbus</h1>
                    <h2>Aggregating Your Online Life</h2>

                    <p>
                        Nimbus was my first foray into web development, created mainly during the Summer of 2013. The
                        goal of Nimbus was to allow users to aggregate multiple cloud storage accounts from different
                        providers into a single view.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ruby on Rails and CoffeeScript were used during development. The backend was mainly responsible
                        for user authentication, OAuth management, and serving static content. The frontend uses this
                        information to query the APIs of the cloud providers to show files.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nimbus supported a wide set of features such as image preview, reCAPTCHA based registration
                        checks, push state based navigation, secure email based password reset, and responsive design.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Beacon</h1>
                    <h2>Location Relevant Messaging</h2>

                    <p>
                        Beacon was a 36 hour hackathon project created for HackISU Fall 2015. I created the backend
                        service for the project as well as the majority of the Android user interface. The goal of
                        Beacon was to allow users to find location relevant messages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The core idea of Beacon is that users could create a message only viewable within a given
                        radius. Viewed messages are ranked according to several metrics such as the size of the radius,
                        the age of the message, and message karma. Messages are additionally given a set lifespan.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Use cases for Beacon include large events such as hackathons or commentary for small
                        gatherings such as a lecture.

                    <h1>Alisa</h1>
                    <h2>A Modern Day Turing Test</h2>

                    <p>
                        Alisa was a 36 hour hackathon project created for HackISU Spring 2015. The core idea of Alisa
                        was to perform a mass Turing Test on users by connecting Tinder users to the non-malicious
                        Cleverbot. For this project I worked both on the backend service and fronted client for the
                        application.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our profile would automatically like any users in a given area before moving on to the next
                        area. If one hasn't been started yet it will start a conversation with the other user. All
                        messages were stored and displayed in real-time in the web application.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project presented several engineering challenges. We needed to reverse engineer the Tinder
                        API using Burp Suite. Implementing efficient realtime notifications was also a challenge.

                    <h2>Calendaring Made Social</h2>

                    <p>
                        SoCal was created as a semester long group project during Spring 2014. I was responsible for
                        developing the backend service for the application. SoCal was designed to be a social calendar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        SoCal let users add others as friends and view their calendars. Users could create multiple
                        calendars shared with other users. Users could choose their mode of transportation and get
                        reminders at the time they needed to leave based on their location. Recurring events could be
                        created.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The backend had several responsibilities. It had to keep user credentials and manage OAuth. It
                        had to maintain a graph of user friends and privacy settings for each. It needed to manage push
                        notifications to alert users of changes to a friend's calendar.
                    </p>
